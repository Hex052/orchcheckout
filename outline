Program
Contents and checkout passed as arguments if not in same folder
From files, copy lines individually into array (in struct also containing total number of lines)
	Individual lines: { short unsigned linenum, char *linechars }
Parse contents lines for type and number, sort into separate array with line numbers
	struct{ char *num, struct *next, struct *prev}
Take in checkouts, do similar
	struct{ char *num, char *name, struct *numnext, struct *numprev, struct *namenext, struct *nameprev}

Two arrays, one for instruments, another for pointers into list of chkouts or inventory.
Don't use int for numbers, as you can have a 12B and 12A, or items may be lettered instead.
